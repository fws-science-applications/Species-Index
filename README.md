# Species-Index
Species Index for the SECAS BP 2021 Update

Within this repository are the following artificats: 
#Compressed folder containing the .tiff version of the Species Index - this is the final dataset product
#FAQ Document - contains a summary of the dataset
#Python script used to create the final index
#links to download needed data inputs


When producing the script, data was stored locally, as such to reproduce one would need to change file path locations within the script for the needed input datasets.
