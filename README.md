# Species-Index
Species Index for the SECAS BP 2021 Update

Within this repository are the following artificats: 
#FileGDB that contains the needed data to reproduce the species index as well as the already processed species dataset
#FAQ Document - contains a summary of the dataset
#Python script used to create the final index

When producing the script, data was stored locally, as such to reproduce one would need to change file path locations within the script.
